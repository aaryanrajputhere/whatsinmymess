# whatsinmymess

I still remember the day me ,Irfan and Vaibhav Kanda were talking about things which we could build. I remember Irfan showing me a website someone in SRM created that basically shows you what's the next meal in your mess. 

So I decided to make it for NITJ and now it's actually live.

It was a fun and cool project for me which actually taught me a lot.





P.S. - Thanks to Pratik for helping me out with the CSS part.
